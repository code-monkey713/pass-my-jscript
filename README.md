# Javascript Password Generator

This is my password generator project using JavaScript! 

## Description

This is the first project built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for password generator where the end user can select the length of password between 8 to 128 characters. This is the industry standard for a secure password. End user will have an option to include lower case characters, upper case characters, numbers, and special characters. 

You can contact me with any suggestions and improvements to the app.
